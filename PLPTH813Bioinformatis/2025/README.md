#### Goals of the course
PLPTH813 will cover the basic principle of regular bioinformatics applications and emphasize the practice of bioinformatics in biological research. The course will introduce some useful computation skills, such as Unix commands, R, and Python, and then will apply these computational skills throughout the course. This course will be focused on the application of bioinformatics in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, including variant discovery, genotyping, RNA-seq, genome assembly, comparative genomics and so on. The ultimate goal of this course is to help students to be prepared for using powerful computational resources and effectively handling biological data, particularly large genomic data.

#### Other notes
We will use command lines for data analysis throughout the course labs. Students are required to have the Beocat account that allows you to access the Beocat server. You can apply for an account from [the Beocat website](https://account.beocat.ksu.edu/).  

#### Academic Honesty and Integrity Statement
Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters oneâ€™s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation. For more information, visit [the Honor & Integrity System home web page](http://www.k-state.edu/honor).

#### Statements for Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.  If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career Advising Center at acac@k-state.edu or call 785-826-2649.

#### Statement Defining Expectations for Classroom Conduct
All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article VI, Section 3, number 2.  Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class. 

#### Statement for Copyright Notification
Copyright 2018 Sanzhen Liu as to this syllabus and all lectures.  During this course students are prohibited from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course.

#### AI Policy
This course encourages and embraces the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a student in this course, you will sometimes be required to incorporate AI tools in your work. Our use of AI will allow us to develop our understanding of this technology and examine the complex challenges and opportunities it offers to us, both as students and future professionals. In accordance with university policies around academic integrity in the Student Code of Conduct, we will be transparent in our use of AI in the completion of any classroom tasks. Using an AI tool to generate assignment content without proper attribution would be a violation of [the K-State Honor Pledge](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html).
